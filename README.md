Hi! this is my first data engineering project. Full version on Medium : # [Internet Usage Analysis ; Data pipeline end-to-end Project [Medium]](https://medium.com/@chawanwit.petch/building-an-end-to-end-data-pipeline-for-internet-usage-analysis-on-google-cloud-platform-5e424dae0ae4) (SQLs are on medium)
